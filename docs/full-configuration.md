# Configuring SFTPGo

## Command line options

The SFTPGo executable can be used this way:

```console
Usage:
  sftpgo [command]

Available Commands:
  gen          A collection of useful generators
  help         Help about any command
  initprovider Initializes and/or updates the configured data provider
  portable     Serve a single directory
  serve        Start the SFTP Server

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for sftpgo
  -v, --version

 Use "sftpgo [command] --help" for more information about a command
```

The `serve` command supports the following flags:

- `--config-dir` string. Location of the config dir. This directory is used as the base for files with a relative path, eg. the private keys for the SFTP server or the SQLite database if you use SQLite as data provider. The configuration file, if not explicitly set, is looked for in this dir. We support reading from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile and Java properties config files. The default config file name is `sftpgo` and therefore `sftpgo.json`, `sftpgo.yaml` and so on are searched. The default value is the working directory (".") or the value of `SFTPGO_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.
- `--config-file` string. This flag explicitly defines the path, name and extension of the config file. If must be an absolute path or a path relative to the configuration directory. The specified file name must have a supported extension (JSON, YAML, TOML, HCL or Java properties). The default value is empty or the value of `SFTPGO_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.
- `--loaddata-from` string. Load users and folders from this file. The file must be specified as absolute path and it must contain a backup obtained using the `dumpdata` REST API or compatible content. The default value is empty or the value of `SFTPGO_LOADDATA_FROM` environment variable.
- `--loaddata-clean` boolean. Determine if the loaddata-from file should be removed after a successful load. Default `false` or the value of `SFTPGO_LOADDATA_CLEAN` environment variable (1 or `true`, 0 or `false`).
- `--loaddata-mode`, integer. Restore mode for data to load. 0 means new users are added, existing users are updated. 1 means new users are added, existing users are not modified. Default 1 or the value of `SFTPGO_LOADDATA_MODE` environment variable.
- `--loaddata-scan`, integer. Quota scan mode after data load. 0 means no quota scan. 1 means quota scan. 2 means scan quota if the user has quota restrictions. Default 0 or the value of `SFTPGO_LOADDATA_QUOTA_SCAN` environment variable.
- `--log-compress` boolean. Determine if the rotated log files should be compressed using gzip. Default `false` or the value of `SFTPGO_LOG_COMPRESS` environment variable (1 or `true`, 0 or `false`). It is unused if `log-file-path` is empty.
- `--log-file-path` string. Location for the log file, default "sftpgo.log" or the value of `SFTPGO_LOG_FILE_PATH` environment variable. Leave empty to write logs to the standard error.
- `--log-max-age` int. Maximum number of days to retain old log files. Default 28 or the value of `SFTPGO_LOG_MAX_AGE` environment variable. It is unused if `log-file-path` is empty.
- `--log-max-backups` int. Maximum number of old log files to retain. Default 5 or the value of `SFTPGO_LOG_MAX_BACKUPS` environment variable. It is unused if `log-file-path` is empty.
- `--log-max-size` int. Maximum size in megabytes of the log file before it gets rotated. Default 10 or the value of `SFTPGO_LOG_MAX_SIZE` environment variable. It is unused if `log-file-path` is empty.
- `--log-verbose` boolean. Enable verbose logs. Default `true` or the value of `SFTPGO_LOG_VERBOSE` environment variable (1 or `true`, 0 or `false`).
- `--profiler` boolean. Enable the built-in profiler. The profiler will be accessible via HTTP/HTTPS using the base URL "/debug/pprof/". Default `false` or the value of `SFTPGO_PROFILER` environment variable (1 or `true`, 0 or `false`).

Log file can be rotated on demand sending a `SIGUSR1` signal on Unix based systems and using the command `sftpgo service rotatelogs` on Windows.

If you don't configure any private host key, the daemon will use `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa` and `id_ed25519` in the configuration directory. If these files don't exist, the daemon will attempt to autogenerate them. The server supports any private key format supported by [`crypto/ssh`](https://github.com/golang/crypto/blob/master/ssh/keys.go#L33).

The `gen` command allows to generate completion scripts for your shell and man pages.

## Configuration file

The configuration file contains the following sections:

- **"common"**, configuration parameters shared among all the supported protocols
  - `idle_timeout`, integer. Time in minutes after which an idle client will be disconnected. 0 means disabled. Default: 15
  - `upload_mode` integer. 0 means standard: the files are uploaded directly to the requested path. 1 means atomic: files are uploaded to a temporary path and renamed to the requested path when the client ends the upload. Atomic mode avoids problems such as a web server that serves partial files when the files are being uploaded. In atomic mode, if there is an upload error, the temporary file is deleted and so the requested upload path will not contain a partial file. 2 means atomic with resume support: same as atomic but if there is an upload error, the temporary file is renamed to the requested path and not deleted. This way, a client can reconnect and resume the upload.
  - `actions`, struct. It contains the command to execute and/or the HTTP URL to notify and the trigger conditions. See [Custom Actions](./custom-actions.md) for more details
    - `execute_on`, list of strings. Valid values are `pre-download`, `download`, `pre-upload`, `upload`, `pre-delete`, `delete`, `rename`, `ssh_cmd`. Leave empty to disable actions.
    - `execute_sync`, list of strings. Actions to be performed synchronously. The `pre-delete` action is always executed synchronously while the other ones are asynchronous. Executing an action synchronously means that SFTPGo will not return a result code to the client (which is waiting for it) until your hook have completed its execution. Leave empty to execute only the `pre-delete` hook synchronously
    - `hook`, string. Absolute path to the command to execute or HTTP URL to notify.
  - `setstat_mode`, integer. 0 means "normal mode": requests for changing permissions, owner/group and access/modification times are executed. 1 means "ignore mode": requests for changing permissions, owner/group and access/modification times are silently ignored. 2 means "ignore mode for cloud based filesystems": requests for changing permissions, owner/group and access/modification times are silently ignored for cloud filesystems and executed for local filesystem.
  - `temp_path`, string. Defines the path for temporary files such as those used for atomic uploads or file pipes. If you set this option you must make sure that the defined path exists, is accessible for writing by the user running SFTPGo, and is on the same filesystem as the users home directories otherwise the renaming for atomic uploads will become a copy and therefore may take a long time. The temporary files are not namespaced. The default is generally fine. Leave empty for the default.
  - `proxy_protocol`, integer. Support for [HAProxy PROXY protocol](https://www.haproxy.org/download/1.8/doc/proxy-protocol.txt). If you are running SFTPGo behind a proxy server such as HAProxy, AWS ELB or NGNIX, you can enable the proxy protocol. It provides a convenient way to safely transport connection information such as a client's address across multiple layers of NAT or TCP proxies to get the real client IP address instead of the proxy IP. Both protocol versions 1 and 2 are supported. If the proxy protocol is enabled in SFTPGo then you have to enable the protocol in your proxy configuration too. For example, for HAProxy, add `send-proxy` or `send-proxy-v2` to each server configuration line. The following modes are supported:
    - 0, disabled
    - 1, enabled. Proxy header will be used and requests without proxy header will be accepted
    - 2, required. Proxy header will be used and requests without proxy header will be rejected
  - `proxy_allowed`, List of IP addresses and IP ranges allowed to send the proxy header:
    - If `proxy_protocol` is set to 1 and we receive a proxy header from an IP that is not in the list then the connection will be accepted and the header will be ignored
    - If `proxy_protocol` is set to 2 and we receive a proxy header from an IP that is not in the list then the connection will be rejected
  - `startup_hook`, string. Absolute path to an external program or an HTTP URL to invoke as soon as SFTPGo starts. If you define an HTTP URL it will be invoked using a `GET` request. Please note that SFTPGo services may not yet be available when this hook is run. Leave empty do disable
  - `post_connect_hook`, string. Absolute path to the command to execute or HTTP URL to notify. See [Post connect hook](./post-connect-hook.md) for more details. Leave empty to disable
  - `max_total_connections`, integer. Maximum number of concurrent client connections. 0 means unlimited. Default: 0.
  - `max_per_host_connections`, integer.  Maximum number of concurrent client connections from the same host (IP). If the defender is enabled, exceeding this limit will generate `score_limit_exceeded` events and thus hosts that repeatedly exceed the max allowed connections can be automatically blocked. 0 means unlimited. Default: 20.
  - `defender`, struct containing the defender configuration. See [Defender](./defender.md) for more details.
    - `enabled`, boolean. Default `false`.
    - `ban_time`, integer. Ban time in minutes.
    - `ban_time_increment`, integer. Ban time increment, as a percentage, if a banned host tries to connect again.

    - `score_valid`, integer. Score for valid login attempts, eg. user accounts that exist.
    - `score_limit_exceeded`, integer. Score for hosts that exceeded the configured rate limits or the maximum, per-host, allowed connections.
    - `observation_time`, integer. Defines the time window, in minutes, for tracking client errors. A host is banned if it has exceeded the defined threshold during the last observation time minutes.
    - `entries_soft_limit`, integer.
    - `entries_hard_limit`, integer. The number of banned IPs and host scores kept in memory will vary between the soft and hard limit.
    - `safelist_file`, string. Path to a file containing a list of ip addresses and/or networks to never ban.
    - `blocklist_file`, string. Path to a file containing a list of ip addresses and/or networks to always ban. The lists can be reloaded on demand sending a `SIGHUP` signal on Unix based systems and a `paramchange` request to the running service on Windows. An host that is already banned will not be automatically unbanned if you put it inside the safe list, you have to unban it using the REST API.
  - `rate_limiters`, list of structs containing the rate limiters configuration. Take a look [here](./rate-limiting.md) for more details. Each struct has the following fields:
    - `average`, integer. Average defines the maximum rate allowed. 0 means disabled. Default: 0

  - `password_authentication`, boolean. Set to false to disable password authentication. This setting will disable multi-step authentication method using public key + password too. It is useful for public key only configurations if you need to manage old clients that will not attempt to authenticate with public keys if the password login method is advertised. Default: true.
  - `proxy_protocol`, integer.  Deprecated, please use the same key in `common` section.

These FTP commands will be enabled: `HASH`, `XCRC`, `MD5/XMD5`, `XSHA/XSHA1`, `XSHA256`, `XSHA512`. Please keep in mind that to calculate the hash we need to read the whole file, for remote backends this means downloading the file, for the encrypted backend this means decrypting the file. Default `0`.
  - `combine_support`, integer. Set to 1 to enable support for the non standard `COMB` FTP command. Combine is only supported for local filesystem, for cloud backends it has no advantage as it will download the partial files and will upload the combined one.

    - `tls_cipher_suites`, list of strings. List of supported cipher suites for TLS version 1.2. If empty, a default list of secure cipher suites is used, with a preference order based on hardware performance. Note that TLS 1.3 ciphersuites are not configurable. The supported ciphersuites names are defined [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/tls/cipher_suites.go#L52). Any invalid name will be silently ignored.

  - `name`, string. Database name. For driver `sqlite` this can be the database name relative to the config dir or the absolute path to the SQLite database. For driver `memory` this is the (optional) path relative to the config dir or the absolute path to the provider dump, obtained using the `dumpdata` REST API, to load. This dump will be loaded at startup and can be reloaded on demand sending a `SIGHUP` signal on Unix based systems and a `paramchange` request to the running service on Windows. The `memory` provider will not modify the provided file so quota usage and last login will not be persisted. If you plan to use a SQLite database over a `cifs` network share (this is not recommended in general) you must use the `nobrl` mount option otherwise you will get the `database is locked` error. Some users reported that the `bolt` provider works fine over `cifs` shares.
  - `host`, string. Database host. Leave empty for drivers `sqlite`, `bolt` and `memory`
  - `port`, integer. Database port. Leave empty for drivers `sqlite`, `bolt` and `memory`

  - `connection_string`, string. Provide a custom database connection string. If not empty, this connection string will be used instead of building one using the previous parameters. Leave empty for drivers `bolt` and `memory`
  - `sql_tables_prefix`, string. Prefix for SQL tables
  - `track_quota`, integer. Set the preferred mode to track users quota between the following choices:
    - 0, disable quota tracking. REST API to scan users home directories/virtual folders and update quota will do nothing
    - 1, quota is updated each time a user uploads or deletes a file, even if the user has no quota restrictions
    - 2, quota is updated each time a user uploads or deletes a file, but only for users with quota restrictions and for virtual folders. With this configuration, the `quota scan` and `folder_quota_scan` REST API can still be used to periodically update space usage for users without quota restrictions and for folders
  - `delayed_quota_update`, integer. This configuration parameter defines the number of seconds to accumulate quota updates. If there are a lot of close uploads, accumulating quota updates can save you many queries to the data provider. If you want to track quotas, a scheduled quota update is recommended in any case, the stored quota may be incorrect for several reasons, such as an unexpected shutdown while uploading files, temporary provider failures, files copied outside of SFTPGo, and so on. You could use the [quotascan example](../examples/quotascan) as a starting point. 0 means immediate quota update.
  - `pool_size`, integer. Sets the maximum number of open connections for `mysql` and `postgresql` driver. Default 0 (unlimited)
  - `users_base_dir`, string. Users default base directory. If no home dir is defined while adding a new user, and this value is a valid absolute path, then the user home dir will be automatically defined as the path obtained joining the base dir and the username

    - `execute_on`, list of strings. Valid values are `add`, `update`, `delete`. `update` action will not be fired for internal updates such as the last login or the user quota fields.
    - `hook`, string. Absolute path to the command to execute or HTTP URL to notify.
  - `external_auth_program`, string. Deprecated, please use `external_auth_hook`.
  - `external_auth_hook`, string. Absolute path to an external program or an HTTP URL to invoke for users authentication. See [External Authentication](./external-auth.md) for more details. Leave empty to disable.
  - `external_auth_scope`, integer. 0 means all supported authentication scopes (passwords, public keys and keyboard interactive). 1 means passwords only. 2 means public keys only. 4 means key keyboard interactive only. 8 means TLS certificate. The flags can be combined, for example 6 means public keys and keyboard interactive
  - `credentials_path`, string. It defines the directory for storing user provided credential files such as Google Cloud Storage credentials. This can be an absolute path or a path relative to the config dir
  - `prefer_database_credentials`, boolean. When true, users' Google Cloud Storage credentials will be written to the data provider instead of disk, though pre-existing credentials on disk will be used as a fallback. When false, they will be written to the directory specified by `credentials_path`.
  - `pre_login_program`, string. Deprecated, please use `pre_login_hook`.
  - `pre_login_hook`, string. Absolute path to an external program or an HTTP URL to invoke to modify user details just before the login. See [Dynamic user modification](./dynamic-user-mod.md) for more details. Leave empty to disable.

  - `check_password_scope`, defines the scope for the check password hook. 0 means all protocols, 1 means SSH, 2 means FTP, 4 means WebDAV. You can combine the scopes, for example 6 means FTP and WebDAV.
  - `password_hashing`, struct. It contains the configuration parameters to be used to generate the password hash. SFTPGo can verify passwords in several formats and uses, by default, the `bcrypt` algorithm to hash passwords in plain-text before storing them inside the data provider. These options allow you to customize how the hash is generated.
    - `argon2_options`, struct containing the options for argon2id hashing algorithm. The `memory` and `iterations` parameters control the computational cost of hashing the password. The higher these figures are, the greater the cost of generating the hash and the longer the runtime. It also follows that the greater the cost will be for any attacker trying to guess the password. If the code is running on a machine with multiple cores, then you can decrease the runtime without reducing the cost by increasing the `parallelism` parameter. This controls the number of threads that the work is spread across.
      - `memory`, unsigned integer. The amount of memory used by the algorithm (in kibibytes). Default: 65536.
      - `iterations`, unsigned integer. The number of iterations over the memory. Default: 1.

    - `bcrypt_options`, struct containing the options for bcrypt hashing algorithm
      - `cost`, integer between 4 and 31. Default: 10
    - `algo`, string. Algorithm to use for hashing passwords. Available algorithms: `argon2id`, `bcrypt`. For bcrypt hashing we use the `$2a$` prefix. Default: `bcrypt`
  - `password_caching`, boolean. Verifying argon2id passwords has a high memory and computational cost, verifying bcrypt passwords has a high computational cost, by enabling, in memory, password caching you reduce these costs. Default: `true`
  - `update_mode`, integer. Defines how the database will be initialized/updated. 0 means automatically. 1 means manually using the initprovider sub-command.
  - `skip_natural_keys_validation`, boolean. If `true` you can use any UTF-8 character for natural keys as username, admin name, folder name. These keys are used in URIs for REST API and Web admin. If `false` only unreserved URI characters are allowed: ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~". Default: `false`.
  - `create_default_admin`, boolean. If enabled, a default admin user with username `admin` and password `password` will be created on first start. You can also create the first admin user by using the web interface or by loading initial data. Default `false`.

    - `client_auth_type`, integer. Set to `1` to require client certificate authentication in addition to JWT/Web authentication. You need to define at least a certificate authority for this to work. Default: 0.
    - `tls_cipher_suites`, list of strings. List of supported cipher suites for TLS version 1.2. If empty, a default list of secure cipher suites is used, with a preference order based on hardware performance. Note that TLS 1.3 ciphersuites are not configurable. The supported ciphersuites names are defined [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/tls/cipher_suites.go#L52). Any invalid name will be silently ignored. The order matters, the ciphers listed first will be the preferred ones. Default: empty.
    - `proxy_allowed`, list of IP addresses and IP ranges allowed to set `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `CF-Connecting-IP`, `True-Client-IP` headers.

  - `web_root`, string.  Defines a base URL for the web admin and client interfaces. If empty web admin and client resources will be available at the root ("/") URI. If defined it must be an absolute URI or it will be ignored
  - `certificate_file`, string. Certificate for HTTPS. This can be an absolute path or a path relative to the config dir.
  - `certificate_key_file`, string. Private key matching the above certificate. This can be an absolute path or a path relative to the config dir. If both the certificate and the private key are provided, the server will expect HTTPS connections. Certificate and key files can be reloaded on demand sending a `SIGHUP` signal on Unix based systems and a `paramchange` request to the running service on Windows.
  - `ca_certificates`, list of strings. Set of root certificate authorities to be used to verify client certificates.
  - `ca_revocation_lists`, list of strings. Set a revocation lists, one for each root CA, to be used to check if a client certificate has been revoked.

Authentication will be always disabled for the `/healthz` endpoint.
  - `certificate_file`, string. Certificate for HTTPS. This can be an absolute path or a path relative to the config dir.
  - `certificate_key_file`, string. Private key matching the above certificate. This can be an absolute path or a path relative to the config dir.

  - `tls_cipher_suites`, list of strings. List of supported cipher suites for TLS version 1.2. If empty, a default list of secure cipher suites is used, with a preference order based on hardware performance. Note that TLS 1.3 ciphersuites are not configurable. The supported ciphersuites names are defined [here](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/src/crypto/tls/cipher_suites.go#L52). Any invalid name will be silently ignored. The order matters, the ciphers listed first will be the preferred ones. Default: empty.
- **"http"**, the configuration for HTTP clients. HTTP clients are used for executing hooks. Some hooks use a retryable HTTP client, for these hooks you can configure the time between retries and the number of retries. Please check the hook specific documentation to understand which hooks use a retryable HTTP client.
  - `timeout`, float. Timeout specifies a time limit, in seconds, for requests. For requests with retries this is the timeout for a single request
  - `retry_wait_min`, integer. Defines the minimum waiting time between attempts in seconds.
  - `retry_wait_max`, integer. Defines the maximum waiting time between attempts in seconds. The backoff algorithm will perform exponential backoff based on the attempt number and limited by the provided minimum and maximum durations.
  - `retry_max`, integer. Defines the maximum number of retries if the first request fails.
  - `ca_certificates`, list of strings. List of paths to extra CA certificates to trust. The paths can be absolute or relative to the config dir. Adding trusted CA certificates is a convenient way to use self-signed certificates without defeating the purpose of using TLS.
  - `certificates`, list of certificate for mutual TLS. Each certificate is a struct with the following fields:
    - `cert`, string. Path to the certificate file. The path can be absolute or relative to the config dir.
    - `key`, string. Path to the key file. The path can be absolute or relative to the config dir.
  - `skip_tls_verify`, boolean. if enabled the HTTP client accepts any TLS certificate presented by the server and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks. This should be used only for testing.
  - `headers`, list of structs. You can define a list of http headers to add to each hook. Each struct has the following fields:
    - `key`, string
    - `value`, string. The header is silently ignored if `key` or `value` are empty
    - `url`, string, optional. If not empty, the header will be added only if the request URL starts with the one specified here
- **kms**, configuration for the Key Management Service, more details can be found [here](./kms.md)
  - `secrets`
    - `url`
    - `master_key_path`

A full example showing the default config (in JSON format) can be found [here](../sftpgo.json).

If you want to use a private host key that uses an algorithm/setting different from the auto generated RSA/ECDSA keys, or more than two private keys, you can generate your own keys and replace the empty `keys` array with something like this:

```json
"host_keys": [
  "id_rsa",
  "id_ecdsa",
  "id_ed25519"
]
```

where `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa` and `id_ed25519`, in this example, are files containing your generated keys. You can use absolute paths or paths relative to the configuration directory specified via the `--config-dir` serve flag. By default the configuration directory is the working directory.

If you want the default host keys generation in a directory different from the config dir, please specify absolute paths to files named `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa` or `id_ed25519` like this:

```json
"host_keys": [
  "/etc/sftpgo/keys/id_rsa",
  "/etc/sftpgo/keys/id_ecdsa",
  "/etc/sftpgo/keys/id_ed25519"
]
```

then SFTPGo will try to create `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa` and `id_ed25519`, if they are missing, inside the directory `/etc/sftpgo/keys`.

The configuration can be read from JSON, TOML, YAML, HCL, envfile and Java properties config files. If your `config-file` flag is set to `sftpgo` (default value), you need to create a configuration file called `sftpgo.json` or `sftpgo.yaml` and so on inside `config-dir`.

## Environment variables

You can also override all the available configuration options using environment variables. SFTPGo will check for environment variables with a name matching the key uppercased and prefixed with the `SFTPGO_`. You need to use `__` to traverse a struct.

Let's see some examples:

- To set the `port` for the first sftpd binding, you need to define the env var `SFTPGO_SFTPD__BINDINGS__0__PORT`
- To set the `execute_on` actions, you need to define the env var `SFTPGO_COMMON__ACTIONS__EXECUTE_ON`. For example `SFTPGO_COMMON__ACTIONS__EXECUTE_ON=upload,download`

On some hardware you can get faster SFTP performance by replacing the Go `crypto/sha256` implementation with [sha256-simd](https://github.com/minio/sha256-simd).

The performances of SHA256 is relevant for clients using AES CTR ciphers and `hmac-sha2-256` as Message Authentication Code (MAC).

Up to 2.0.x versions SFTPGo automatically used `sha256-simd` but over the time the standard Go implementation improved a lot and now is faster than `sha256-simd` on some CPUs.
You can select `sha256-simd` setting the environment variable `SFTPGO_MINIO_SHA256_SIMD` to `1`.

 `sha256-simd` is particularly useful if you have an Intel CPU with SHA extensions or an ARM CPU with Cryptography Extensions.

## Telemetry Server

The telemetry server exposes the following endpoints:

- `/healthz`, health information (for health checks)
- `/metrics`, Prometheus metrics
- `/debug/pprof`, if enabled via the `enable_profiler` configuration key, for profiling, more details [here](./profiling.md)
